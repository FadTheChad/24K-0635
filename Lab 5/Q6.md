# Reason

We are given the following expression for `x`:

```c
x = 5 > 8 ? 10 : 1 != 2 < 5 ? 20 : 30;
```

Since `5 > 8` is **false**, this gets reduced to:

```c
x = 1 != 2 < 5 ? 20 : 30;
```

The condition `2 < 5` runs first, which is **true**.

```c
x = 1 != 1 ? 20 : 30;
```

Since `1 != 1` is **false**, this gets reduced to:

```c
x = 30;
```

Hence the value of `x` becomes `30`, and the output is `30`.
